            <p>In this project, we're building neural networks (ANNs) to recognize handwritten digits. Each module is based on a simple ANN with two hidden layers, forming the basis for four distinct models. Neural networks function by simulating the brain's neural connections, processing input data through layers of interconnected neurons and adjusting weights to minimize prediction error during training. Each model in our project differs by incorporating a specific regularization technique, such as L2, Dropout and Early Stopping, which are crucial for preventing overfitting in neural networks. In general, these techniques work by penalizing large parameter values (complexity), improving the network's ability to generalize to unseen data. Through empirical analysis, we'll explore how each regularization technique affects the accuracy of our basic neural network in digit recognition.</p>
