            <p>For this project, I collaborated in a group of three to develop a Discord recipe bot using Python and Selenium WebDriver. The bot scrapes recipes from the web and delivers them directly in a Discord chat. My main contribution was implementing a dynamic categories component with a dropdown menu, allowing users to select options like "desserts" or "vegan." The bot would then instantly return a relevant recipe based on their selection. By combining web scraping, Python automation, and Discord's API, we made it easy for users to quickly find recipes, whether they were craving something specific or working with ingredients they had on hand.</p>
